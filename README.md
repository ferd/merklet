# Merklet #

Reimplementation of Riak's old merkle tree module, but in a more readable
manner (according to me). Other difference include:

- Renaming some functions just because
- Insertion wants only binaries for keys and values, but makes no assumption
  with regards to hashing.
- Deleting nodes doesn't leave empty inner nodes as part of the tree, and
  inner nodes with a single child node see the child promoted to the current
  level.
- Slightly more efficient diffing. This is due to not having as many leftover
  inner nodes, and using difference lists on offsets of two inner nodes instead
  of iterating across all offsets. I.e. the cost is linear with the number of
  children of an inner node, rather than a flat minimal 255 rounds for each.
- The diff algorithm explicitly points out differences in keys *and* values,
  not just keys.
- It is possible to do incremental tree diffing over the network, and uses
  an internal binary serialization format that could eventually be opened
  and usable by more languages.

Further documentation (and changes) to come.

Todo list:

- I'd like to finalize the serialization format and make it public rather
  than private to the module to be more language-agnostic
- Specify an actual protocol for types of distributed calls, although that
  may be left to a higher-level library.
